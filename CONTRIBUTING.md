# Contributing to Symfony GuzzleBundle

üëç First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! üéâ

## Reporting a Bug
Whenever you find a bug in this bundle, we kindly ask you to report it. It helps us make a better GuzzleBundle.
Report it using the official bug [tracker][1] and follow some basic rules:

- Use the title field to clearly describe the issue
- Describe the steps needed to reproduce the bug with short code examples (providing a unit test that illustrates the bug is best)
- Give as much detail as possible about your environment (PHP version, GuzzleBundle version, Symfony version, ...)


## Adding Feature
You can request a new feature by submitting an issue to our [GitHub Repository][1].
If you would like to implement a new feature, please submit an issue with a proposal for your work first, to be sure that we can use it. Please consider what kind of change it is:

- For a Major Feature, first open an issue and outline your proposal so that it can be discussed. This will also allow us to better coordinate our efforts, prevent duplication of work, and help you to craft the change so that it is successfully accepted into the project.
- Small Features can be crafted and directly submitted as a Pull Request.


## Coding Standards
When contributing code to this bundle, you must follow the [Symfony coding standards][2]. To make a long story short, here is the golden rule: Imitate the existing Symfony code.
Most open-source Bundles and libraries used by Symfony also follow the same guidelines, and you should too.

Remember that the main advantage of standards is that every piece of code looks and feels familiar, it's not about this or that being more readable.
