This bundle integrates [Guzzle 5.x][1] into Symfony. Guzzle is a PHP framework for building RESTful web service clients.
It comes with a WSSE Auth Plugin that can be used optionally.

GuzzleBundle follows semantic versioning. Read more on [semver.org][2].

## Requirements
 - PHP 5.5.0 or above
 - [Guzzle PHP Framework][1] (included by composer)
 - [WSSE Auth Plugin][3] (included by composer)

 
## Installation
To install this bundle, run the command below and you will get the latest version by [Packagist][4].

``` bash
composer require eightpoints/guzzle-bundle
```

To use the newest (maybe unstable) version please add following into your composer.json:

``` json
{
    "require": {
        "eightpoints/guzzle-bundle": "dev-master"
    }
}
```


## Usage
Load bundle in AppKernel.php:
``` php
new EightPoints\Bundle\GuzzleBundle\GuzzleBundle()
```

Configuration in config.yml:
``` yaml
guzzle:
    base_url: "http://api.domain.tld"

    # custom headers
    headers:
        Accept: "application/json"

    # plugin settings
    plugin:
       wsse:
           username: acme
           password: pa55w0rd
```
All these settings are optional. If WSSE username is defined the WSSE plugin will be injected automatically.

Using services in controller:
``` php
$client   = $this->get('guzzle.client');
$response = $client->get('/users');
```

## Suggestions
Adding aliases:
If you want to use different names for provided services you can use aliases. This is a good idea if you don't want 
have any dependency to guzzle in your service name.
``` yaml
services:
   http.client:
       alias: guzzle.client
```
