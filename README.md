This bundle integrates [Guzzle 6.x][1] into Symfony. Guzzle is a PHP framework for building RESTful web service clients.

GuzzleBundle follows semantic versioning. Read more on [semver.org][2].

----

## Requirements
 - PHP 7.0 or above
 - Symfony 2.7 or above
 - [Guzzle PHP Framework][1] (included by composer)

----

## Installation
##### Command line:
To install this bundle, run the command below and you will get the latest version by [Packagist][3].

``` bash
composer require eightpoints/guzzle-bundle
```

##### composer.json
To use the newest (maybe unstable) version please add following into your composer.json:

``` json
{
    "require": {
        "eightpoints/guzzle-bundle": "dev-master"
    }
}
```

##### Using Symfony Flex
Also it is possible to install bundle through [Symfony Flex][4]. It works for Symfony 3.3 and higher.  
Bundle will be added to kernel file and default configuration will be created automatically.

```bash
composer config extra.symfony.allow-contrib true
composer require eightpoints/guzzle-bundle
```
_Note: for symfony 3.3 and 3.4 you should install symfony/flex by yourself. From 4.0 it is included be default._

----

## Usage
##### Load bundle in AppKernel.php:
``` php
new EightPoints\Bundle\GuzzleBundle\EightPointsGuzzleBundle()
```

##### Configuration in config.yml:
``` yaml
eight_points_guzzle:
    # (de)activate logging/profiler; default: %kernel.debug%
    logging: true

    clients:
        api_payment:
            base_url: "http://api.domain.tld"

            # guzzle client options (full description here: https://guzzle.readthedocs.org/en/latest/request-options.html)
            # NOTE: "headers" option is not accepted here as it is provided as described above.
            options:
                auth:
                    - acme     # login
                    - pa55w0rd # password

                headers:
                    Accept: "application/json"
                
                # Find proper php const, for example CURLOPT_SSLVERSION, remove CURLOPT_ and transform to lower case.
                # List of curl options: http://php.net/manual/en/function.curl-setopt.php
                curl:
                    sslversion: 1 # or !php/const:CURL_HTTP_VERSION_1_0 for symfony >= 3.2

                timeout: 30

            # plugin settings
            plugin: ~

        api_crm:
            base_url: "http://api.crm.tld"
            options:            
                headers:
                    Accept: "application/json"

        ...
```
Allowed options: headers, allow_redirects, auth, query, curl, cert, connect_timeout, debug, decode_content, delay, form_params, multipart, sink, http_errors, expect, ssl_key, stream, synchronous, timeout, verify, cookies, proxy, version. All these settings are optional.  
Description for all options and examples of parameters can be found [here][5].

##### Install assets _(if it's not performed automatically)_:
``` bash
# for symfony >= 3.0
bin/console assets:install

# for symfony < 3.0
app/console assets:install
```

Using services in controller (eight_points_guzzle.client.**api_crm** represents the client name of the yaml config and is an instance of GuzzleHttp\Client):
``` php
/** @var \GuzzleHttp\Client $client */
$client   = $this->get('eight_points_guzzle.client.api_crm');
$response = $client->get('/users');
```

----

## Plugins
This bundle allows to register and integrate plugins to extend functionality of guzzle and this bundle.

### Usage
All plugins will be activated/connected through bundle constructor in AppKernel, like this:

``` php 
new EightPoints\Bundle\GuzzleBundle\EightPointsGuzzleBundle([
    new Gregurco\Bundle\GuzzleBundleWssePlugin\GuzzleBundleWssePlugin(),
])
```

### Known and Supported Plugins
- [gregurco/GuzzleBundleWssePlugin][6]
- [gregurco/GuzzleBundleCachePlugin][7]
- [gregurco/GuzzleBundleOAuth2Plugin][8]

----

## Events
Handling events. Events are dispatched before and after the request to the remote host.

### Listening To Events
```xml
    <service id="listenerID" class="Your\ListenerClass\That\Implements\GuzzleEventListenerInterface">  
        <tag name="kernel.event_listener" event="eight_points_guzzle.pre_transaction" method="onPreTransaction" service="servicename"/>  
    </service>  
```

Your event Listener, or Subscriber **MUST** implement GuzzleBundle\Events\GuzzleEventListenerInterface.  
Events dispatched are eight_points_guzzle.pre_transaction, eight_points_guzzle.post_transaction.  
The service on the tag, is so that if you have multiple REST endpoints you can define which service a particular listener is interested in.

----

## Features

### Symfony Debug Toolbar / Profiler
<img src="/src/Resources/doc/img/debug_logs.png" alt="Debug Logs" title="Symfony Debug Toolbar - Guzzle Logs" style="width: 360px" />

### Symfony logs
All requests are logged into symfony default logger (`@logger` service) with next format:
```
[{datetime}] eight_points_guzzle.{log_level}: {method} {uri} {code} 
```
Example:
```
[2017-12-01 00:00:00] eight_points_guzzle.INFO: GET http://api.domain.tld 200
```

You can change message format by overriding `eight_points_guzzle.symfony_log_formatter.pattern` parameter. See allowed variables [here][9].

----

## Suggestions
Adding aliases:
If you want to use different names for provided services you can use aliases. This is a good idea if you don't want
have any dependency to guzzle in your service name.
``` yaml
services:
   crm.client:
       alias: eight_points_guzzle.client.api_crm
```
