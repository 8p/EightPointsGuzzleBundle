This bundle integrates [Guzzle 6.x][1] into Symfony. Guzzle is a PHP framework for building RESTful web service clients.
It comes with a WSSE Auth Plugin that can be used optionally.

GuzzleBundle follows semantic versioning. Read more on [semver.org][2].

----

## :exclamation: Important :exclamation:

Use v7 of Guzzle Bundle! Just critical issues are fixed in v6.

Compatibility table:

| PHP      | Symfony    | Guzzle Bundle |
|----------|------------|---------------|
| 5.x, 7.x | ~          | v7            |
| 5.x      | 3.2 - 3.4  | v6.2.1        |
| 5.x      | 2.8 - 3.2  | v6.2.0        |

----

    }
}
```

----

## Usage
Load bundle in AppKernel.php:
``` php
new EightPoints\Bundle\GuzzleBundle\GuzzleBundle()
```

Configuration in config.yml:
``` yaml
guzzle:
    # (de)activate logging/profiler; default: %kernel.debug%
    logging: true

    clients:
        api_payment:
            base_url: "http://api.domain.tld"

            # custom headers (@deprecated, will be removed in v6; new: "headers" in options (see below))
            headers:
                Accept: "application/json"

            # guzzle client options (full description here: https://guzzle.readthedocs.org/en/latest/request-options.html)
            # NOTE: "headers" option is not accepted here as it is provided as described above.
            options:
                auth:
                    - acme     # login
                    - pa55w0rd # password

                headers:
                    Accept: "application/json"

                timeout: 30

            # plugin settings
            plugin:
                wsse:
                    username:   "acme"
                    password:   "pa55w0rd"
                    created_at: "-10 seconds" # optional

        api_crm:
            base_url: "http://api.crm.tld"
            headers:
                Accept: "application/json"

        ...
```
All these settings are optional. If WSSE username is defined the WSSE plugin will be injected automatically.

Using services in controller (guzzle.client.**api_crm** represents the client name of the yaml config and is an instance of GuzzleHttp\Client):
``` php
/** @var \GuzzleHttp\Client $client */
$client   = $this->get('guzzle.client.api_crm');
$response = $client->get('/users');
```

----

## Events
Handling events.  Events are dispatched before and after the request to the remote host.
### Listening To Events
```xml
    <service id="listenerID" class="Your\ListenerClass\That\Implements\GuzzleEventListenerInterface">  
        <tag name="kernel.event_listener" event="guzzle_bundle.pre_transaction" method="onPreTransaction" service="servicename"/>  
    </service>  
```

Your event Listener, or Subscriber **MUST** implement GuzzleBundle\Events\GuzzleEventListenerInterface.  
Events dispatched are guzzle_bundle.pre_transaction, guzzle_bundle.post_transaction.  
The service on the tag, is so that if you have multiple REST endpoints you can define which service a particular listener is interested in.

## Features
### Symfony Debug Toolbar / Profiler

----

## Suggestions
Adding aliases:
If you want to use different names for provided services you can use aliases. This is a good idea if you don't want
have any dependency to guzzle in your service name.
``` yaml
services:
   crm.client:
       alias: guzzle.client.api_crm
```
